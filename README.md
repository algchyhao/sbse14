This code is an instantiation   of the following ideas.

FIRST PRINCIPLES
=================

TISTF: Truth is Shorter than Fiction
-------------------------------------

If you do not understand it, you cannot code it succinctly.
So to check if you understand it, try to code it.

BeValued:
---------

The real worth of a machine is what added value it
gives back to the community. Be valued. Give of
yourself- your wisdom, your tricks, your tips,
captured in code, shared in a publicly accessible repo, 
available for
all.

No man is an _Iland_,  
intire of it selfe;   
every man is a peece of the _Continent_,   
a part of the _maine_;  
if a _Clod_ bee washed away by the _Sea,   
Europe_ is the lesse,   
as well as if a _Promontorie_ were,   
as well as if a _Mannor_ of thy _friends_ or of _thine owne_ were;   
any mans _death_ diminishes _me_,   
because I am involved in _Mankinde_;   
And therefore never send to know for whom the _bell_ tolls;   
It tolls for _thee_.  
-- John Donne, 1623

DOOR SOURCE: OpenSource, OpenDoor, SpecialSauce
---------------------------------------------------

For years and years, I made my money by what I could
give away. I made my code open source so it open
doors to people who, otherwise, might not care
to. Once inside those doors, I earned a living
configuring (adding the special sauce) those the
open tools since, for the tools I created, I was one
of the few people who really understoof the crucial tweaks
that make all the difference.

SHOW OFF:
--------

Code should know how to show off. All files end in

    if __name__ == '__main__': doSomethingCool();

See also _YCYR_.

TTS: Teach the Source:
----------------------

Teach from the code. One lecture = what you can show
students in one hour.

YCYR: Your Code = Your Resume
------------------------------

When going for jobs, imagine sending prospective
employees your Github repo containing impressive
code. Think how much more interested that would make
them.

PYTHON RULES
============

2.7: Two point seven 
--------------------

Use Python 2.7+, not Python 3, since many useful
libraries are NOT yet ported to Python 3. 

Hopefully,  this rule will soon change.
 
ATMC: Add the missing code.
---------------------------

All python files should start with 

    from __future__ import division 
    import sys 
    sys.dont_write_bytecode = True
    """ some copyright notice """
	
Also, as said in _SHOW OFF_, all files should end
with:

	if __name__ == '__main__': doSomethingCool();

BCD: Beware container defaults 
------------------------------

Default params to functions, methods are evaluated
at load time. Which means that N calls to a function
with an argument that defaults to, say, an empty
list will always be talking to the *same* list,
every time you call the function.

IRU: Iterators 'r us
---------------------

Don't understand the following? Then work it out!

    def item(items):
      if isinstance(items,(list,tuple)):
        for one in items:
          for x in item(one):
            yield x
      else:
        yield items


LRU: Lambdas 'r us
-------------------

Anonymous functions (lambdas) rule. Allows for simple
implementation of generics, just by passing in a lambda
body. And stuff like the following is just wicked cool:

    tree = lambda: collections.defaultdict(tree)
    root = tree()
    root['menu']['id'] = 'file'
    root['menu']['value'] = 'File'
    root['menu']['menuitems']['new']['value'] = 'New'
    root['menu']['menuitems']['new']['onclick'] = 'new();'

NO W: No Wraps
---------------

Sooner or later, your code will be added to some print out,
perhaps even in a two-column format. When it does, you still
want it to look beautiful. So:

+ All code <= 52 characters. 
+ Not "self" but "i". 
+ Indents using 2 spaces. 
+ Try to keep functions, classes, under 60 lines 
  (and much less is much better).

STACK OVERFLOW
---------------

Any Python question you want answered has already
been asked and answered already on
stackoverflow.com. Read it!

CODING RULES
============

BBB: Burn baby burn
-------------------

_"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing
more to add, but when there is nothing left to take
away."_   
-- Antoine de Saint-Exupery

Once it starts works, burn some of it away.
Benchmark it against a simpler option.  Throw away
what does not improve performance. Note: often, you
can throw away a lot of superfluous stuff

CA: Constants Aren't:
----------------------

Put the code in a function where the 'constants' are
defaults to function arguments (so later, you can
call it another way).

HAIL REPO: 
----------

The code repo is your off-site backup, your undo
facility, your sharing tool. Use it. Always.  Many
times a day.

IDM: It doesn't matter.
-----------------------

Don't waste time arguing in theory about some tuning
issue. Just try it out. It probably won't matter in
practice.

JDI: Just do it.
----------------

Systems are not written; they grow. So find the
smallest next thing and just do that. Repeat.

KISS: 
-----

keep it simple stupid.

LIB: Leave it Broken:
---------------------

At the end of the day, leave behind a broken test
(this is where you can start back up, tomorrow).

NoGo: Globals are Evil:
-----------------------

N-1 globals is better than N globals.


NBO: No Buried Options
----------------------

Keep all 'The' settings. Print 'The' settings in
front of all output.

R: Refactor:
------------

To code it once, just do it.  If you code it twice,
wince.  But if you code it thrice, refactor.

RESUMABLE: 
----------

An anytime computation is stoppable and resumable.
 
For long computations, implement occasional "dump to
disk" and "restart from part-way". That way, if the
long computation crashes, you can restart from some
interim point (and not redo it all).

TAG: 'Things' Are Good
---------------------

Consider not defining a new class if a simple 'Thing'
will do (useful for named access to data only
classes).

TDD: Test Driven Development:
-----------------------------

Write a test.
Write the code.
Fix the fault.
Run all tests
Fix the faults.
Repeat.

YAGNI: 
------

You aren't gonna need it. Only code stuff that is
needed for your latest test. All other
generalizations are hallucinations.

SCIENCE RULES
==============

ESM: Effect size matters.
-------------------------

Statistical significance tests can condone very small
variations in large computations. So always use an effect
size test with the significance test to avoid small
number bullsh*t.

NET: Nine equals ten
--------------------

Minor numeric differences in performance are usually
unstable and disappear when you run the experiment
again. So don't fret the small deltas. 
Always seek the "big a*s" differences.

FSSS: Fast stats, slow stats.
-----------------------------

Two kinds of statistical tests: fast and slow.
Fast tests (parametric, e.g. t-tests) are used as heuristics
during a run to check for (say) early stopping. Slow tests
(non-parametric, e.g. bootstraps) are used after the run
to confirm some experimental hypothesis.

KTS: Keep the seed.
-------------------

To allow for reproduction, keep the seed and print
it as part of the options.

NAN: Normal ain't normal
------------------------

Much reasoning assumes a standard bell shaped
"normal" distribution.  But normal distributions are
not normally found in real world data. So favor
non-parametric distributions over trite normal
descriptions of data.

RNC: Random not crazy 
---------------------

Often the stochastic version is simpler, or scales
better, or both.

MOEA rules
==========

MaxSmarter
----------

Never show users something minimizing something. This
is America! Always maximize!

Klass to Summary to Example
---------------------------

At its core, my MOEAs manipulate a table of data:

+ Each column of that table is a feature and each row is one
  example.
+ The _i-th_ cell of each example
  is the _i-th_ _value_ of the _i-th_ feature

Internally, the features divide into:

+ Dependent features  (aka _depen_) we are trying to minimize or mazimize
  (internally, these are known as the  _less_ and the _more_, respectively).
+ Independent (aka _indep_) features we can control;
		
Our meta-knowledge of those examples is kept in a
high-level _summary_.  
Each item in the _summary_ knows about

+ what values that *might* be added to an example;
+ what values that *were* found in the examples.

Using that knowledge, a _summary_  can:

- _Guess_ possible values for the variables in a example;
- Check if a new example is _ok_; i.e. is valid;
- _Score_ a example; i.e. using a list's independent variables,
  it can set the dependent variables.
- _Record_ a example's content; i.e. incrementally update counters
  in the summary showing what values were found in the examples.

Note that there is one summary per feature.
So if we make 1000 examples,
where each list is a example of size 5, then there
exists *one* _summary_ that is a list of size 5 (and the _i-th_ summary
refers to the _i-th_ value in all the examples).

The lifecycle of example is:

1. At design time, we build a _klass_ that defines how to generate a _summary_.
2. At runtime, we start by using that _klass_ to build a particular _summary_.
3. From that particular _summary_, we generate  independent values;
      + And, at this stage, all the dependent values are null.
4. Optionally, we can use those independent values to compute the dependent values.
      + Note it is invalid to guess dependent variables since these
	    should be computed from the independent variables.
5. Optionally, we can  add those values to a synopsis of values
   seen so far.
